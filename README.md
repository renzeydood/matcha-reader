# Matcha Reader, a Japanese learning fork of CrossPoint

> **X4 Pro development:** integration with current CrossPoint is in progress on `MATC-001-marge-crosspoint-1.6.0`. The first X4 Pro smoke test has passed, and touch support now covers the Library, reading statistics, manga lists, the manga reader, word lookup and page translation. Remaining validation is tracked in the [integration log](docs/x4pro-merge-resolution-log.md).

The experimental X4 Pro integration adds CrossPoint's touch reader toolbar while retaining Matcha's Japanese reading controls under **Reader Settings**. Build checks, smoke-test results and remaining touch work are tracked separately in the integration log.

For experimental installation and testing, see the [device and emulator test guide](docs/x4pro-install-and-test.md). Both firmware targets compile; emulator compatibility and physical-device behavior remain unvalidated.

On the experimental branch, SD recovery starts with built-in fonts and default settings,
bypassing saved settings, SD fonts and automatic book reopening. On X4 Pro, hold **Down**
while waking with **Power** to enter recovery; Home and light-panel shortcuts are disabled
there. To leave recovery, release the wake buttons, then hold **Power** for two
seconds to restart. A pending firmware update opens Home first and is accepted only after its first
render completes. This defers software acceptance; automatic rollback still depends on
the bootloader installed on the device. See the [boot review](docs/x4pro-boot-review.md)
for remaining limitations and the recovery test checklist.

A fork of [CrossPoint](https://github.com/crosspoint-reader/crosspoint-reader) e-reader firmware for the Xteink X4 and X3, built for reading Japanese. Vertical text, instant dictionary lookup with verb deinflection, a manga panel reader, and page translation, all on e-ink.

It includes all features of upstream CrossPoint and runs on any supported X4 or X3. You can try it first in the [emulator](https://github.com/eszter007/Crosspoint-Emulator-Matcha).

## Features

### Vertical Japanese text

Japanese books are detected from their metadata and set vertically: right-to-left columns, kinsoku line breaking, sesame emphasis marks, and furigana beside the kanji. A per-book toggle overrides the detection when you disagree with it.

  <img src="docs/images/screenshots/vertical-text.png" width="260" alt="Vertical Japanese text">
  <img src="docs/images/screenshots/horizontal-text.png" width="260" alt="The same passage with vertical text switched off">
</p>
<p align="center"><em>The same passage, Vertical Text on and off</em></p>

### Dictionary and word lookup

Look up any word on the page, vertically or horizontally. Conjugations resolve to the dictionary form on their own (読んで becomes 読む, 食べませんでした becomes 食べる), and the page is scanned first so you only land on words that actually have an entry.

Lookup keeps the page exactly as you were reading it — same font, same size, same line breaks. Every word the dictionary can match is marked, with a side-line (傍線) down the left of the column in vertical text so it stays clear of the furigana, and an underline in horizontal text. The current word is boxed; **Confirm** opens its entry full screen. On touch devices you can tap a marked word to select it and tap it again to open the entry.

Vocabulary, names and grammar each come from their own dictionary. If the book itself annotated a reading, the entry opens with "In this book: はやし" and remembers it for the rest of the book. See [Setup](#setup) for the files, and [§6.2](USER_GUIDE.md#62-word-lookup) for how to drive it.

Reader Settings includes **Word Lookup Font Size** (Tiny, Small, Medium or Large) for adjusting dictionary entry text.

### Page translation

Translates the current page to English with Gemini. Works in any book, not only Japanese ones. Needs Wi-Fi and your own API key. On touch devices, swipe or tap the upper and lower halves of the page to scroll, and tap the header to close.

<p align="center"><img src="docs/images/screenshots/translate-page.png" width="260" alt="A translated page"></p>

### Manga panel reader

Panels are detected at conversion time, along with their text and translations, so lookup and translation work offline and appear instantly. Move panel by panel in reading order, each one scaled to fill the screen. On touch devices, manga reading follows the same page-turn tap/swipe and center/menu gestures as EPUB reading. Manga chapter and bookmark lists support tap-to-open and swipe scrolling; long-press a manga bookmark to delete it.

**Rotate Panels** (Settings, on by default) turns a panel whose shape does not match the screen, so a wide panel fills the display and you turn the device to read it. Switch it off to keep every panel upright inside the current orientation. **Panels Only** skips the full page overviews. Both are covered in [§6.4](USER_GUIDE.md#64-reading-manga).

Convert with the [browser tool](https://eszter007.github.io/matcha-reader-tools/), or see [Converting manga](#converting-manga).

</p>

### Library

Every book on the card as a cover grid, at any depth. Covers and titles come from the book's own metadata on first
visit, with progress as a badge. Manga sits beside EPUBs. A **Shelves** tab lists folders that contain books. On touch
devices, tap a book to open it, long-press it for per-book stats, swipe the grid to scroll, and tap **Books** or
**Shelves** to switch tabs. Shelf rows and shelf books can also be opened by touch.

<p align="center"><img src="docs/images/screenshots/library.png" width="260" alt="Library grid with manga and EPUB covers side by side"></p>

### Reading stats

Streak, minutes this week, books finished, total time, and a calendar of the days you read. Recorded as you go, every few minutes and again when you close a book, so a flat battery costs you minutes rather than the whole session.

Press **Details**, or tap the overall stats page on touch devices, for the same numbers per language, one tab each.
Long press a book in the Library for its own sessions, total time, average session and calendar. On touch devices,
swipe vertically to scroll stats pages, swipe horizontally to change month, and tap a language tab to switch languages.

  <img src="docs/images/screenshots/book-stats.png" width="240" alt="Per-book stats for one book">
</p>

Manga counts the same as EPUBs. Language comes from the book, so set `--language` when you convert manga. Details and the known limits are in [§7](USER_GUIDE.md#7-reading-stats).

### Transparent sleep screen

A wallpaper laid over the page you were reading, so the book shows through instead of being covered. Set **Sleep Screen** to **Transparent** and drop 480x800 BMPs into `.sleep/transparent/` on the card. Images with plenty of white space work best, since anything solid hides the text under it. See [§3.7](USER_GUIDE.md#37-sleep-screen).

On the experimental integration branch, `/sleep-overlay.bmp`, `/sleep-overlay.png`, and images in `/.sleep-overlay/` (or `/sleep-overlay/`) take priority when present. Existing `.sleep/transparent/` and `/sleep/transparent/` artwork remains a fallback.

<p align="center"><img src="docs/images/screenshots/sleep-screen-transparent.png" width="260" alt="Sleep wallpaper over the page text, which stays readable behind it"></p>

### Also in this fork

- Per-book reader settings: font, size, spacing, margins and orientation are remembered per book
- A built-in CJK fallback font, so the odd kanji in a non-Japanese book still renders
- **Optimize EPUB** on upload: splits single-file Japanese novels into real chapters with a working table of contents, and fits images to the screen as dithered 1-bit BMPs
- More of the book's own CSS respected: headings sized as headings, line spacing, page breaks, boxed asides, and rules written as `.callout p`
- **Use Book Margins** (Text Settings > Layout, on by default) keeps the indents a book sets for itself, so epigraphs and long quotations stay inset. Turn it off and those blocks sit flush with the body text
- Instant image page turns, since the next image decodes in the background
- A file browser that shows everything on the card, with unsupported files greyed out rather than hidden
- Fully localised, in all the languages CrossPoint ships

## Setup

> No Python needed. [**Matcha Reader Tools**](https://eszter007.github.io/matcha-reader-tools/) converts dictionaries, fonts and manga in your browser and hands back a zip laid out for the card. Files stay on your machine, except manga OCR, where panels go to Gemini under your own key. ([source](https://github.com/eszter007/matcha-reader-tools))

**1. Flash the firmware** with the standard CrossPoint process, see the [upstream docs](https://github.com/crosspoint-reader/crosspoint-reader).

**2. Install dictionaries.** Word lookup needs at least a vocabulary dictionary.

Dictionaries are picked by the book's language. Put each one in `dictionaries/<lang>/`, using the language shorthand: `de` for German, `en` for English, `fr` for French, and so on. A book tagged with that language then selects it automatically.

```
dictionaries/
  en/your_dictionary_name/     # English, StarDict files
  fr/your_dictionary_name/     # French, StarDict files
  jp/                          # Japanese, Yomitan files converted for the device
    vocab.idx    vocab.dat    vocab.spx      # vocabulary (required)
    names.idx    names.dat    names.spx      # names (recommended)
    grammar.idx  grammar.dat  grammar.spx    # grammar reference (optional)
```

Japanese is the exception: it always uses the converted files in `dictionaries/jp/`, from [Jitendex](https://github.com/stephenmk/Jitendex), [JMnedict](https://github.com/JMdictProject) or any other Yomitan dictionary. Every other language uses plain StarDict.

The dictionary you pick in Settings becomes the fallback, used when the book has no language or no folder matches it. Reader Settings shows which dictionary a book actually ended up with.

Convert with the [browser tool](https://eszter007.github.io/matcha-reader-tools/), or the script:

```bash
python3 tools/dict_convert/convert_jmdict.py \
  --input jitendex-yomitan.zip \
  --output-dir /path/to/sd/dictionaries/jp/    # add --name names / --name grammar for the others
```

**3. Install a Japanese font** (optional). The built-in Noto handles Japanese, but a dedicated font looks better. Convert any TTF or OTF with the [browser tool](https://eszter007.github.io/matcha-reader-tools/) and put the result in `.fonts/<Family>/regular.cpfont`. An SD card Japanese font also fills in rare kanji elsewhere, such as dictionary entries and book titles.

**4. Set up translation** (optional). Get a key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey) and save it as `/system/gemini.key` on the card.

Using all of it: [§6 of the User Guide](USER_GUIDE.md#6-japanese-reading-features).

## Converting manga

The [browser tool](https://eszter007.github.io/matcha-reader-tools/) needs no local setup. As a script:

```bash
pip install ultralytics huggingface_hub Pillow
export GEMINI_API_KEY=$(cat /path/to/gemini.key)

python3 tools/manga_convert/convert_manga.py \
  --input /path/to/manga.cbz \
  --output-dir /path/to/sd/manga/MangaTitle/ \
  --language ja \
  --x4
```

Set `--language` on every manga. It is what splits your reading time by language, and most manga carries no language of its own. The tag is read at conversion time, so a book converted without it counts as unknown until you convert it again.

`--input` takes an image folder, `.cbz`, `.zip`, `.epub` or PDF. The flags worth knowing:

| Flag | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `--x4` / `--x3` | Scale to the device screen. Smaller files, faster page turns, nothing lost. |
| `--mono` | 1-bit dithered BMP. Good for line art, less so for heavy screentone. |
| `--no-ocr` | Panel boxes only, no Gemini calls, no text or translations. |
| `--max-pages N` | Convert the first N pages as a cheap test. |
| `--title` / `--author` | Override metadata. |
| `--language` | Book language tag. See above. |

Panels are found with a YOLO model trained on Manga109 ([leoxs22/manga-panel-detector-yolo26n](https://huggingface.co/leoxs22/manga-panel-detector-yolo26n)), falling back to a white-gutter heuristic without `ultralytics`. Gemini then reads and translates each panel.

The output is a folder of images, panel crops and three small index files. Drop it anywhere on the card, the Library finds any folder containing `panels.idx`.

## Building from source

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/eszter007/matcha-reader.git
cd matcha-reader
git submodule update --init --recursive   # if you cloned without --recursive
pio run              # build
pio run -t upload    # flash
```

The X4 Pro build also writes `.pio/build/x4pro/matchareader-1.6.0-x4pro.bin` alongside PlatformIO's standard
`firmware.bin`. Same PlatformIO setup as upstream. For desktop testing see the
[emulator](https://github.com/eszter007/Crosspoint-Emulator-Matcha). Development notes are in [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md),
the on-card cache formats in [docs/file-formats.md](docs/file-formats.md).

## Compatibility with upstream

This fork tracks upstream CrossPoint and merges new releases. Nearly everything is additive: new libraries (`lib/Dict/`, `lib/MangaPanel/`), new activities (word lookup, translation, manga reader) and the vertical text engine. Existing files see only auto-detection and menu wiring, so merges stay cheap.
