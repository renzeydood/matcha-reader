  // The speculative cache warms (next page / panels) used to decode JPEGs synchronously inside

  // being called for that whole window; button edges are events, not queued state, so presses
  // AND releases landing inside the window simply evaporated ("takes multiple clicks to
  // register" on JPEG books). The warms now run on this dedicated worker task instead.
  //
  // Design rules (each one is a hard invariant, not a preference):
  //  * The worker is LOCK-FREE: it never takes RenderLock. ActivityManager's pop path calls
  //    onExit() while HOLDING RenderLock, and onExit() joins this worker -- a worker blocked on
  //    that same lock would deadlock the join. Consequently the worker also never touches the
  //    renderer: decodes run cacheOnly (see RenderConfig), and geometry comes from the pure
  //    computeFullPageGeom/computePanelGeom helpers with screen dims captured once at onEnter
  //    (see baseScreenW/baseScreenH above -- no renderer reads off the render task at all).
  //  * Results are handed BACK to the loop task (applyPrefetchResult), which owns the existing
  //    locked-write discipline for panelDims and the done-flags. The worker never writes them.
  //  * The worker decodes into cachePath + ".tmp" and publishes by rename. A real render may
  //    decode-and-cache the SAME asset concurrently (it streams to the real path); two write
  //    handles on one FAT file corrupt the volume. SdFat's rename opens the destination
  //    O_CREAT|O_EXCL (verified, SdFat 2.3.1 FatFile::rename), so publish fails cleanly if the
  //    render got there first -- the worker then just deletes its tmp.
  //  * Cancellation: the decode's per-block cancel probe checks prefetchExitRequested and
  //    RenderLock::peek(). The moment a real render starts (or the activity exits), the decode
  //    aborts within one MCU block/scanline and its partial tmp is dropped -- so a background
  //    warm never competes with a foreground render for CPU/SD beyond a few ms.
  //  * Single-slot job queue with strict ownership ping-pong: loop() writes prefetchJob and
  //    prefetchResult only while prefetchBusy is false and no result is pending; the worker
  //    touches them only between the notify that follows busy=true and its own busy=false.
  //    The strings/struct members therefore need no locking of their own.
  //  * pageGeneration stamps jobs; loadCurrentPagePanels() bumps it (under RenderLock) on every
  //    page change, so results of a stale in-flight warm are dropped instead of poisoning the
  //    new page's panelDims/flags.
